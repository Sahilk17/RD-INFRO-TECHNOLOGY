# Task 5 - UART Serial Communication

## Objective
To send data from Arduino Uno to the Serial Monitor using UART communication.

## Components Used
- Arduino Uno
- Wokwi Simulator

## Arduino Code

```cpp
void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  Serial.println("Data Sent");
  delay(1000);
}
```

## Working
Arduino initializes serial communication at 9600 baud rate and sends the message "Data Sent" every second to the Serial Monitor.

## Result
UART serial communication was successfully established and data was displayed on the Serial Monitor.
